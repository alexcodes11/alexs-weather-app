# Alex's-Weather-App

Welcome to my Weather App project!!! First of all, I wanted to explain that I have another two seperate repositories for this application. One repository is for the Backend (Node.js Proxy Server) and the other repostitory is for the Frontend (React). This is perfect because if I ever want to expand this project I can have dedicated repositories. This will be much more organzied. And when I want to deploy changes I can connect them on this repository.
