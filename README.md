# Alex's-Weather-App

Welcome to my Weather App project!!! First of all, I wanted to explain that I have another two seperate repositories for this application. One repository is for the Backend (Node.js Proxy Server) and the other repostitory is for the Frontend (React). This is perfect because if I ever want to expand this project I can have dedicated repositories. This will be much more organzied. And when I want to deploy changes I can connect them on this repository.

## Node.js Proxy Server
You can check out the code here: [github.com/alexcodes11/Weather](https://github.com/alexcodes11/Weather). Now, let's talk a little about what I did in the backend... 
First, I fetched the third-party APIs. This allowed me to create my own REST API. I added caching and rate limiting to the API. I also secured the API key.


## React Frontend
