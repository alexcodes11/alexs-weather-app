# Alex's-Weather-App

Welcome to my Weather App project!!! First of all, I wanted to explain that I have another two seperate repositories for this application. The reason is because I wanted to work on different. One repository is for the Backend (Node.js Proxy Server) and the other repostitory is for the Frontend (React).
